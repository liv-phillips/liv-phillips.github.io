					<h3>My name is Liv Phillips, and I am a senior <strong>Computer Science</strong> major at Carleton College</h3>. I enjoy both front and backend development, with a preference towards being able to move between them. I'm passionate about the intersection that technology has with social good, and would love to be involved with a company that shared this passion with me. I have <strong>experience</strong> with Java, C, Python, HTML/CSS, Kafka, Hadoop, and Zookeeper.

							<h2><strong>Social Impact </strong> Project</h2>
							<a href="https://cs-experiences.tumblr.com/">Collecting CS Stories at Carleton College</a>
						</br></br>
							<p> This past year, I worked with a group of other students to collect stories about student experiences in my school's CS department. We knew that our department, like the tech world as a whole, could be a very different place for people depending on their race, gender, ability, and socioeconomic status. Because of these factors, some students haven't been able to get the support they need to continue in Computer Science. We wanted our study to help us identify concrete issues within the department, so that we could then come up with ways that professors, TAs, prefects, and other students could make changes to ensure that we are providing the proper resources necessary for all students to be able to succeed within our department. 
							</br></br>
							We also believed that part of the reason that students left our department was because they mistook systemic issues to be flaws within themselves, or believed they were the only one having negative experiences with CS. In order to help offset these feelings of isolation and personal failure we created a website with selected excerpts that our participants agreed to have published. These excerpts speak on issues ranging from imposter syndrome, to the feeling of being the only person of your race in a class, to not being able to afford a computer of your own. We hope that the website, along with a document we sent to our CS professors, will be a step towards change in our department.
